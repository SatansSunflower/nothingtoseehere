# Introduction

This docu is written as an installation guide / structure for following tools: 

* XAMPP
* MySQL Workbench (+ Visual C++ download potentially)
* Visual Studio Code 

**This page is currently in edit**

# Install XAMPP 

**Step 1:** Check if XAMPP is already installed (Search bar + look inside C:/) 

**Step 2:** Install XAMPP: https://www.apachefriends.org/ 

**Step 3:** [click here for further instruction if needed](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/tools/xampp-tutorial-create-your-own-local-test-server/)

## Troubleshoot XAMPP 

If you start and open XAMPP and your dashboard is showing but files are not, you have to remove / edit the index.php file! Then it should work.

# Install MySQL Workbench 

**Step 1:** Check if it is not already installed! 

**Step 2:** Download from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)

**Note:** you do not need to log into oracle, just skip it 

**Note:** A little guide on MySQL Workbench can be found here soon! (otherwise remind me to write it lol)
#TODO:

If you are prompted to install the Visual C++ AddOn you can do that [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170)
